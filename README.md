👋 Hi, I'm Kai | Front-End Developer in the Making
Welcome to my coding journey! I'm a detail-oriented front-end developer with an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science (Middlesex County College) and currently advancing my skills as a Bachelor’s student at Rider University. I thrive on turning ideas into clean, interactive web experiences—one line of CSS and JavaScript at a time.

🌱 Current Focus
🔨 Building foundational projects (like a cafe menu and CSS markers) to master HTML/CSS and UI design principles.

🎨 Experimenting with design – gradients, animations, responsive layouts.

⚡ Next steps: Diving deeper into JavaScript and exploring frameworks like React.

🛠️ Toolbox
✔ Core: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
✔ Styling: Flexbox, Grid, CSS Animations, Responsive Design
✔ Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
✔ Soon-to-Learn: React, Bootstrap, or [your next goal]

📂 Featured Projects
☕ Cafe Menu – A responsive menu page showcasing CSS layout techniques.
🎨 CSS Colored Markers – A playful demo of gradients, shadows, and pseudo-elements.

📚 Education
A.S. Computer Science | Middlesex County College(Graduated during the summer session)

B.S. in Progress | Rider University
